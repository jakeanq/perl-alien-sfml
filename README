INSTALLATION

Alien::SFML presents an important message to you:
================>>>IMPORTANT!<<<================
Due to platform inconsistancies, Windows being a pain,
the lack of mice on titan and the general state of the
universe, Alien::SFML has decided to not actually bother
testing your computer to see if it has SFML 2.0 RC
installed unless you use pkg-config.  

If you choose to install it yourself, please tell this
script about it: Set the variables \$PERLSFMLLIBS and
$PERLSFMLCFLAGS to the appropriate values (the same
format as what pkg-config would give. Makefile.PL will
check the above environment variables first, then try
pkg-config then finally just go ahead and install it.
$PERLSFMLLIBS will be rejected if it doesn't appear to
include a '-l' in it.

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install
